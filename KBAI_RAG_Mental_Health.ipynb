We introduce the current context for the relationship between nature and mental health and an overview of the key issues. Then, we set out our detailed policy recommendations. As human beings, we are all profoundly influenced by the environment we grow up in and live in. Our social, economic, and cultural circumstances affect our emotional development and well-being, and so make our connection with nature. Nature’s well-being is intrinsic to our own experience of health and wellbeing. The natural environment has the potential to be enormously beneficial to our health and wellbeing, yet almost everywhere we look, the role and visibility of nature is diminishing. The night sky is obscured by light pollution, agricultural monocultures have replaced many biodiverse wild areas, and, in our daily lives, technology and screen use is rising while mindful time spent in nature is declining.\n",

            "Learn more about the need for preventative measures across integrated care systems and how this will address public mental ill-health. This short policy summary is part of a series setting out the major changes that are needed to improve mental health. Local health systems differ across the UK; this paper focuses on England. It draws upon Mental Health Foundation research and analysis which can be found in the 'further reading' section. We have a health and care system that is geared towards late intervention and crisis management. This current model of waiting for people to develop mental health problems and then seeking to treat them is an ineffective way of improving the population’s mental health. Instead, we must reorientate national and local systems towards prevention. Poor mental health remains the biggest contributor to overall population ill health in the UK. Levels of poor mental health are unacceptably high and have been rising since 2000.[1] Mental ill-health has an economic and social cost of £117.9 billion a year, approximately 5% of UK GDP, with the majority of costs falling outside the health care sector, most notably through lost employment and informal care costs.[2] The economic and social inequalities and adversity that manifest in our communities have a direct bearing on the physical and mental health of the population. The only way this can effectively be addressed is through a more cohesive and co-ordinated approach in which these social determinants of mental health are prioritised by national and local systems, with shared outcomes measures, clear encouragement and guidance and sharing of good practice from government. These inequalities are spread across many areas of our lives including poverty, income and food insecurity, housing, experience of abuse and neglect, employment, education, and access to public transport. Often, they intersect with injustices such as racism, misogyny and homophobia. All these have an impact on the mental health and wellbeing of the population. Despite the urgency for action, the public health system is under greater pressure than at any time in living memory, with a 26% cut in funding for the Public Health Grant, on a per head basis, since 2015/16. [3] The Health and Care Act 2022 put Integrated Care Systems (ICSs) on a statutory footing, with the Government making it an explicit requirement that Integrated Care Board mental health representatives should also be focused on prevention. But such work remains the exception.\n",

            "The future of public mental health will depend on clear definitions, agreed priorities, effective structures and systems, improved levels of investment, and collaborative working that goes beyond traditional stakeholders. Achieving this will yield a significant return on investment and save future expenditure on health, social care and criminal justice services. The evidence is clear that it is the places and circumstances in which people are born, grow, study, live and work that have a powerful influence on their mental health. Good evidence exists for a range of public mental health interventions, including parenting programmes, anti-bullying programmes and the right support for women in the perinatal period.[4] These well-evidenced interventions should be widely available and provided at scale, as they can reduce the risk or severity of mental health problems, enhance mental wellbeing, and support the delivery of a broad range of outcomes relating to health, family relationships, education and employment.[5] Our own evidence review with the LSE indicates that there is an ever-growing evidence base of studies supporting cost-effective interventions to prevent mental health problems, many of which have been carried out in a UK context and show a positive return on investment.[6] National work on public mental health should be: Most of the substantial costs associated with mental health conditions do not fall on health care systems.[7] Investment in preventing mental health conditions therefore has the potential to be highly cost-effective; the challenge is to facilitate more investment in prevention across the UK, within and beyond public health and health care systems.

            "Location: Scotland Our work working with refugees and asylum seekers in Scotland through our Elevate project opened our eyes to the challenges and barriers they face in accessing and using public transport in Scotland. We undertook research with the aim of developing a comprehensive understanding of what refugees and people seeking asylum in Scotland are experiencing regarding public transport. Read the report or download as a PDF below. This report was created in partnership with Tactran and CTA. The Mental Health Foundation’s Elevate project aims to increase the representation of people from refugee and asylum-seeking backgrounds in decision-making processes within transport, health and social care, education and policing acrossScotland. Our work through the Elevate project opened our eyes to the challenges and barriers faced by refugees and people seeking asylum in accessing and using public transport in Scotland. We also discovered how few forums exist for citizens to share their experiences and opinions with transportation providers. Motivated by this insight, we undertook research as part of Elevate, with the aim of developing a comprehensive understanding of what refugees and people seeking asylum in Scotland are experiencing regarding public transport. Findings from this research will be used to inform transport providers and advocate with this marginalised group for positive change for their community and beyond. In this report, we first outline the research design and participants. We then report on the types of transport people use, reasons for travel and affordability, before reporting on their experience of the quality of services. Finally, we report on participants’ recommendations for how to improve public transport in Scotland. The study employed a mixed-methods approach, incorporating quantitative and qualitative data collection. Three in-person focus groups were conducted in Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Perth respectively. These locations were chosen to capture a range of experiences from refugees and people seeking asylum living in urban and semi-urban settings – the settings in which this population is most likely to be accommodated. For the Glasgow focus group, participants were recruited through existing Mental Health Foundation contacts in refugee and asylum-seeking communities, including learners studying the accredited Health Issues in the Community course with us. As the Mental Health Foundation has done less work with the refugee and asylum-seeking communities in other parts of Scotland, we worked with local organisations and individuals in Edinburgh and Perth to recruit participants for those groups. Specifically, we collaborated with ESOL Perth and the Perth Minorities Association to recruit for the Perth focus group. Similarly, we worked with an ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) volunteer based in Edinburgh to recruit participants for the Edinburgh focus group.\n",

Following transcription, frequently occurring themes were identified, which were used in a thematic analysis which examined broader themes and patterns that emerged across the focus groups. The Mental Health Foundation delivers the accredited Health Issues in the Community Course for learners from refugee and asylum-seeking backgrounds. As part of this course, 6 learners conducted a community research project between the period October to December 2023 about experiences of public transportation in Scotland for people seeking asylum. Their project involved conducting 31 peer-to-peer interviews with people seeking asylum in Glasgow to gather their experiences of transport and feedback on what they think needs to change. The interviewers took notes of what intervieweesshared. Once all interviews had been carried out, this data was thematically analysed along with the focus group data. To complement the qualitative data gathered through focus groups and to better understand refugee and asylum seeker experiences of transport across Scotland’s urban and rural areas, we ran an online survey using Smart Survey. The survey comprised 17 questions, capturing demographic information, the cost of public transport and the associated impact, experiences with transport staff, feelings of safety while travelling, and the impact that free travel would have on mental health. The survey was distributed through existing contacts of MHF staff in the refugee and asylum-seeking community and through partner organisations. The survey was live between 10 August and 9 October 2023 and received 222 complete responses during this time. The data from the survey was analysed using Excel. National demographic data for refugees and people seeking asylum in Scotland is not publicly available, meaning we are not able to compare how representative our sample is. Demographic data was not collected for focus group participants. However, from observation, the participants appeared to be diverse in gender, age, religion, ethnicity, and country of origin. Some participants had disabilities, mobility needs, andlong-term health conditions. As shown in Figure 1, the mode of public transport most frequently used by survey respondents is the bus. 94% of respondents regularly use the bus, 40% regularly use the train, and 21% regularly use the subway. Focus group participants also told us that they mostly use the bus network to travel around their local area and further afield, due to it generally being more affordable and convenient than alternatives. There was some positive feedback about the buses: “I take the bus...\n"

            "The questions and answer options may not be as specific as a doctor or therapist might be in an in-person testing environment. Most individuals with mental health issues can and will find treatments that are successful. That means you can get better. Some mental health issues, however, are chronic and ongoing, but even these can be managed with proper treatment and intervention. Recovery from mental health disorders or issues requires ongoing attention to your mental and overall health, as well as adherence to any behavioral therapy techniques learned from a therapist. In some cases, treatments like medication may be needed on an on-going basis; others may be able to stop using them at some point. What recovery will mean for you is different than recovery for another person. Mental health is a vital concern for healthcare professionals. Most people know the signs and symptoms of physical illnesses, like a heart attack or stroke. But, they may not be able to pinpoint the physical effects of anxiety, PTSD, or panic. Awareness campaigns are designed to help people understand these common signs and symptoms. More than 40 million Americans experience some form of mental illness every year. Knowing that they’re not alone may invite people to seek treatment from a professional. Treatment is key to relief from symptoms and maintain a healthy, active life. Around 21 percent of American teenagers between 13 and 18 years old have experienced a severe mental health disorder, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). Half will develop a disorder by the time they’re 14 years old. A significant number of youth are affected by depression in particular. According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), around 13 percent of Americans between 12 and 17 years old had at least one major depressive episode in 2017. In fact, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) now endorses universal depression screening for 12- to 18-year-olds. These screenings can be performed by a primary care physician. The signs and symptoms of mental illness may be brushed aside as the angst of the turbulent teenage years. But, these may be the earliest predictors of mental health disorders or issues that require treatment. Signs of mental health issues in teenagers include: Share this article Grief looks and feels different for each person, but if mourning is persistent and affects all aspects of your life for months, it may be complicated… Read what our team has to share about how they approach spring cleaning.

            "Your GP may be the first person you talk to about your mental health problems. If you have a good relationship with your doctor, you may find it helpful just to know there is someone you can talk to about the feelings you are having. Your GP may refer you to specialist services if he/she feels they will help you. You can find information about talking to your GP about your mental health in our guide. If you are unhappy with your own doctor, you can ask to see another doctor at the same practice or make an appointment with a different practice in your area. If you are unsure where to find other doctor’s surgeries, look in your local Yellow Pages or try the NHS Choices website. Most people recover from mental health problems without needing to go into hospital. There are a number of specialist services that provide various treatments, including counselling and other talking treatments. You may also need help with other aspects of your life - for example, claiming benefits or dealing with housing problems. Often these different services are coordinated by a community mental health team (CMHT). CMHTs are usually based either at a hospital or a local community mental health centre. Some teams provide 24-hour services so that you can contact them in a crisis. If you are already in contact with a CMHT you may find it useful to keep their number by your phone in case you need it. Otherwise you should be able to contact your local CMHT via your local social services or social work team. Other kinds of community mental health team include Crisis and Home Treatment teams, which provide you with help in your own home and can come out to see you in an emergency or help you get into hospital if you need inpatient treatment. You may also find it helpful to contact your nearest Citizens Advice Bureau for advice about benefits, debt problems, legal issues and local services. The Citizens Advice Bureau website has a directory listing its local offices. Home of Mental Health Awareness Week\n",

Options include the following: Counseling involves talking, either one-on-one or in groups. Counseling sessions are available face to face or online. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT helps you learn new ways to manage anxiety, for example, how to replace negative thoughts with positive ones. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT): In ACT people learn to use mindfulness, acceptance, and behavioral strategies to be more present and figure out how to live a value-based life despite negative feelings. Group therapy or a support group: This helps you learn social skills and techniques to interact with people in social settings. Working in a group will help you see that you’re not alone and enable role play of practical solutions. Exposure therapy: In this type of therapy, a healthcare professional will help you gradually face social situations rather than avoiding them. Medications can help improve your symptoms and help you function in your daily life. Medications that can treat social anxiety disorder include: SSRIs and SNRIs can take several weeks to have an effect, but propanolol is a short-acting drug that you can use when you need it. You may start with a low dose and gradually increase your prescription to avoid side effects. If you’re unhappy with one medication, the doctor may offer an alternative. The doctor will explain the benefits and risks and help you decide which treatment is right for you. Home and natural remedies can support the treatment recommended by your doctor. Tips to address stress and anxiety include: According to the ADAA, over one-third of people with social anxiety don’t seek help until they have had symptoms for at least 10 years. People may not see their discomfort as a mental health issue, and they may not realize that help is available. Without treatment, social phobia can affect: Up to 90% of people have another condition alongside social anxiety, such as: Counseling therapy, lifestyle changes, and medication can help many people cope with social anxiety and other mental health issues. If you or someone you know is in crisis and considering suicide or self-harm, please seek support: If you’re calling on behalf of someone else, stay with them until help arrives. You may remove weapons or substances that can cause harm if you can do so safely. If you’re not in the same household, stay on the phone with them until help arrives. People with social anxiety either avoid or feel very anxious in social settings. They may blush, sweat, tremble, avoid people, stand rigidly, avoid eye contact, or find it hard to talk. They may not know why they feel anxious, but it’s usually due to a fear of being judged or offending another person. Experts don’t know exactly why it happens, but an imbalance in brain chemicals may play a role.\n",

Other types include: Not everyone with depression will experience precisely the same symptoms, and the symptoms may also depend on the type of depression they have. That said, a person living with MDD may experience some of the following emotions in a persistent way: In addition, they may experience some of the following: Symptoms parents should be aware of in their teens include the following: Depression symptoms in older adults are similar to other age groups. It’s sometimes called geriatric depression and can be a cause of physical pain in older adults that’s not explained by other medical conditions. That said, it’s essential to rule out other medical conditions that may be mimicking depressive symptoms in older adults. The exact cause of MDD is unknown, but researchers believe genetic and environmental factors can be triggers. Having family members with depression may raise your chance of developing it. A combination of genes and stress can affect brain chemistry and lower your ability to maintain mood stability. In addition, changes in the balance of hormones may also contribute to the development of MDD. Possible triggers of MDD include: A doctor or a mental health professional can diagnose MDD based on your symptoms, feelings, and behaviors. Typically, you’ll be asked specific questions or given a questionnaire so health professionals can better determine whether you have MDD or another condition. To be diagnosed with MDD, you need to meet the symptom criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5). According to its criteria: You must also experience 5 or more of the symptoms listed in the manual in the 2-week period. MDD is often treated with medication and psychotherapy. Some lifestyle adjustments can also help ease certain symptoms. People who have severe MDD or have thoughts of harming themselves may need to stay in a hospital during treatment. Some might also need to take part in an outpatient treatment program until symptoms improve. Primary care professionals often start treatment for MDD by prescribing antidepressant medications. SSRIs are a frequently prescribed type of antidepressant. They work by helping inhibit the breakdown of serotonin in your brain, resulting in higher amounts of this neurotransmitter. Serotonin is a brain chemical that’s believed to be responsible for mood. It may help improve mood and produce healthy sleeping patterns. People with MDD are often thought to have low levels of serotonin. An SSRI may relieve symptoms of MDD by increasing the amount of serotonin available in your brain. SSRIs include well-known drugs such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and citalopram (Celexa). They have a relatively low incidence of side effects that most people tolerate well. Similar to SSRIs, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are another type of antidepressant that are often prescribed. These affect serotonin and norepinephrine, which help manage your fight-or-flight response.\n",

            "While some people may experience a loss of appetite in response to stress, others may cope with stressful situations by eating more than usual. High levels of stress can cause difficulties falling or staying asleep for some people. Others may find that high stress causes them to sleep more than usual. Sleep disorders also often occur alongside certain mental health conditions, including depression and anxiety. Additionally, poor sleep quality and insomnia can interfere with your ability to function and may contribute to or exacerbate symptoms of mental health conditions. High amounts of stress can cause feelings of tiredness and fatigue. Not only that, but certain issues associated with stress, such as poor sleep, can also contribute to low energy levels and exhaustion. Some research suggests that stress can cause changes to the function and structure of the brain, which could affect memory and concentration. High levels of stress may also adversely affect learning, making it more difficult to perform at work or school. People experiencing a nervous breakdown may also withdraw from family, friends, and coworkers.

Sources of intense stress might include: If you think you or a loved one might be experiencing a nervous breakdown, make an appointment with a doctor or a mental health professional. Talking with a healthcare professional is especially critical if you’re at risk of hurting yourself or others. The healthcare professional will likely perform a complete physical exam and discuss any medications you’re taking to determine whether other factors are contributing to your symptoms. They may then refer you to a psychotherapist or psychiatrist for further evaluation and treatments, which could include: A doctor may recommend talk therapy to treat your symptoms. One common type of psychotherapy is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT has a proven track record for treating anxiety, depression, and other serious mental health conditions. It involves identifying problematic thought patterns and learning coping skills to better navigate challenging situations. In addition to talk therapy, a doctor may recommend prescription medications to treat symptoms or other diagnosed mental health conditions. This may include antidepressants or anti-anxiety medication. If you’re feeling overwhelmed and on the verge of a breakdown, consider these strategies for managing your symptoms: You can make these changes on your own, but it may be more helpful to work with a healthcare professional to create a treatment plan that best meets your needs. Many people experience an inability to cope with life’s stresses at one time or another. However, stress can become a health concern if it begins to interfere with your ability to complete daily tasks.\n",

            "DBT consists of four elements, known as modules: People receiving DBT are taught skills and coping strategies to help them lead healthier, happier lives. Systematic desensitization is a process that helps you to become less sensitive to certain triggers. It relies heavily on classical conditioning, a type of unconscious and automatic learning that creates behavior. It’s often used in the treatment of phobias. During treatment, you’re taught to replace your fear responses with relaxation responses, which begins with learning relaxation and breathing techniques. Once you’ve mastered these techniques, your therapist will have you face your fear or fears at slowly increasing levels while you use these techniques. Aversion therapy is often used to treat disorders like substance use disorder and alcohol use disorder. It works by teaching people to associate a stimulus (something that triggers a response) that’s pleasant but unhealthy with an extremely unpleasant stimulus. The unpleasant stimulus may be something that causes discomfort. For example, a therapist may teach you to associate alcohol with an unpleasant memory. Behavioral therapy has successfully been used to treat a large number of conditions. It’s considered to be extremely effective. About 75 percent of people who enter cognitive behavioral therapy experience some benefits from this treatment. A 2012 study found that cognitive behavioral therapy is most effective when treating: Studies have shown that play therapy is very effective in children ages 3 to 12 years. But this therapy is increasingly being used in people of all ages. Applied behavioral therapy and play therapy are both used for children. Treatment involves teaching children different methods of responding to situations more positively. A central part of this therapy is rewarding adaptive behaviors that benefit a child’s functioning and discourage maladaptive behaviors, or those that interfere with a child’s best possible functioning. This therapy often requires multiple people in a child’s environment to be committed to the process, including parents, teachers, and other important figures. It may take children some time to trust their counselor. This is to be expected. With time, patience, and focus on building trust, a child may warm up to the point of being able to fully express themselves. This also is heavily dependent on the age of the child. Autistic children with ADHD often benefit from behavioral therapy. Finding a therapist can feel overwhelming, but there are many resources that can make it easier. When finding a therapist or mental health professional, you can choose from: You should make sure that the therapist you choose has the necessary certifications and degrees. Some therapists will focus on treating certain conditions, like eating disorders or depression. If you don’t know how to get started with finding a therapist, you can ask a general practitioner, a doctor who treats a broad range of conditions, for a recommendation. The general practitioner may recommend a psychiatrist if this is appropriate for you. Psychiatrists are able to write prescriptions for medication if they think you might benefit from it.\n",

Tips to address stress and anxiety include: According to the ADAA, over one-third of people with social anxiety don’t seek help until they have had symptoms for at least 10 years. People may not see their discomfort as a mental health issue, and they may not realize that help is available. Without treatment, social phobia can affect: Up to 90% of people have another condition alongside social anxiety, such as: Counseling therapy, lifestyle changes, and medication can help many people cope with social anxiety and other mental health issues. If you or someone you know is in crisis and considering suicide or self-harm, please seek support: If you’re calling on behalf of someone else, stay with them until help arrives. You may remove weapons or substances that can cause harm if you can do so safely. If you’re not in the same household, stay on the phone with them until help arrives. People with social anxiety either avoid or feel very anxious in social settings. They may blush, sweat, tremble, avoid people, stand rigidly, avoid eye contact, or find it hard to talk. They may not know why they feel anxious, but it’s usually due to a fear of being judged or offending another person. Experts don’t know exactly why it happens, but an imbalance in brain chemicals may play a role.\n",

            "Talk therapy is an opportunity for you to talk with a mental health provider about your experiences, feelings, thoughts, and ideas. Therapists primarily act as a sounding board and neutral mediator, helping you learn coping techniques and strategies to manage symptoms. Some people may need brief periods of intensive treatment at hospitals or residential treatment facilities. These programs allow an overnight stay for in-depth treatment. There are also daytime programs, where people can participate in shorter periods of treatment. Alternative treatments can be used in addition to mainstream treatments as a supplement. These steps won’t eliminate mental health issues alone, but they can be helpful. They include sticking to your treatment plan as closely as possible, avoiding alcohol and drugs, and adopting a healthy lifestyle that incorporates foods that may be a benefit to your brain. This includes omega-3 fatty acids, a type of fish oil that occurs naturally in some high-fat fish. The term therapy refers to several styles of talk therapy. Therapy can be used to treat a variety of disorders, including panic disorders, anxiety, depression, anger issues, bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Therapy helps people identify mental health issues and unhealthy behaviors or thought patterns. During sessions you and your therapist can work to change these thoughts and behaviors. In most cases, therapists focus on current issues, things that are affecting your daily life, and help you find solutions to what you’re experiencing in real time, but each doctor’s approach is different. Read more about the different types and what results you might expect from therapy. Mental Health First Aid is a national public education course. It’s designed to teach people about the warning signs and risk factors of mental health issues. In the training, participants learn about treatments and approaches that can help people with mental health disorders. This training program is made for people who regularly interact with patients in a healthcare setting. Through scenarios and role-playing, healthcare providers can learn how to help a person in crisis connect with professional and self-help treatment steps. Physical exercise is great for your body. Dancing, swimming, walking, and jogging boost cardio health and strength. They’re also great for your mind. Research shows they can help reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, there are also “exercises” you can do for your brain. These include: When you talk with your doctor or therapist about your mental health, they may go through a series of examinations in order to reach a diagnosis. These steps could include a physical examination, blood or laboratory tests, and a mental health questionnaire. A series of questions helps doctors understand your thoughts, responses, and reactions to events and scenarios. While this test won’t return immediate results, it will help your doctor better understand what you’re experiencing. Avoid taking online mental health tests. While these may provide some insight into causes of symptoms, they aren’t administered by a healthcare professional.\n",

            "Different groups of people experience SMIs at different rates. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, women are more likely to experience SMI than men. Those ages 18 to 25 are most likely to experience an SMI. People with a mixed-race background are also more likely to experience an SMI than people of other ethnicities. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) helps mental health professionals diagnose mental illnesses. There are many types of mental health disorders. In fact, almost 300 different conditions are listed in DSM-5. These are some of the most common mental illnesses affecting people in the United States: Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental illness that affects about 2.6 percent of Americans each year. It is characterized by episodes of energetic, manic highs and extreme, sometimes depressive lows. These can affect a person’s energy level and ability to think reasonably. Mood swings caused by bipolar disorder are much more severe than the small ups and downs most people experience on a daily basis. Persistent depressive disorder is a chronic type of depression. It is also known as dysthymia. While dysthymic depression isn’t intense, it can interfere with daily life. People with this condition experience symptoms for at least two years. About 1.5 percent of American adults experience dysthymia each year. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) goes beyond regular everyday anxiety, like being nervous before a presentation. It causes a person to become extremely worried about many things, even when there’s little or no reason to worry. Those with GAD may feel very nervous about getting through the day. They may think things won’t ever work in their favor. Sometimes worrying can keep people with GAD from accomplishing everyday tasks and chores. GAD affects about 3 percent of Americans every year. Major depressive disorder (MDD) causes feelings of extreme sadness or hopelessness that lasts for at least two weeks. This condition is also called also called clinical depression. People with MDD may become so upset about their lives that they think about or try to commit suicide. About 7 percent of Americans experience at least one major depressive episode each year. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) causes constant and repetitive thoughts, or obsessions. These thoughts happen with unnecessary and unreasonable desires to carry out certain behaviors, or compulsions. Many people with OCD realize that their thoughts and actions are unreasonable, yet they cannot stop them. More than 2 percent of Americans are diagnosed with OCD at some point in their lifetime. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental illness that’s triggered after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. Experiences that can cause PTSD can range from extreme events, like war and national disasters, to verbal or physical abuse. Symptoms of PTSD may include flashbacks or being easily startled. It’s estimated that 3.5 percent of American adults experience PTSD. Schizophrenia impairs a person’s perception of reality and the world around them. It interferes with their connection to other people. It’s a serious condition that needs treatment.\n",

Symptoms can vary depending on the type of depression and the individual. Some common signs include persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities, changes in appetite or sleep, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, feelings of worthlessness, and thoughts of self-harm or suicide.  Additional signs in teens can include irritability and withdrawal from family and friends. In older adults, sadness may not be the primary symptom, and physical pain or other physical symptoms may be present.
